        <h1>Thank You</h1>

        <p>
            Thank you to everyone who supported this campaign and a vision for making our community and our state stronger by empowering everyone to pursue their dreams.
        </p>

        <p>
            Although we did not achieve all of our goals today, I am proud of the issue-focused campaign we ran and look forward to continuing to work with all of you in pursuit of a more just and equitable society for tomorrow.
        </p>

        <p>
            Change does not always come quickly, and the road we take can be a winding one, but if we stay engaged and continue to fight for the ideals we hold, then our march toward progress is indomitable.
