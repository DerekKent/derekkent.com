            <h1>It Starts With You</h1>
            <p>
                How well do you know your representatives?
            </p>

            <p>
                Do you know that your <a href="/map">District 32</a> State representatives
                have voted consistently against women's rights?
            </p>

            <p>
                All three of our current delegates have consistently received a 0% rating from
                NARAL Pro-Choice Maryland.
            </p>

            <p>
                Do you know that Mark Chang was endorsed by the homophobic organization
                Protect Marriage Maryland? Or that Ted Sophocleus received a 0% rating
                from Equality Maryland? Or that all three of our delegates voted against
                SB 743 (2015) — legislation that was designed to protect LGBT rights?<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Do you know that Ted Sophocleus is endorsed by the NRA and voted against
                legislation to prohibit firearms on college campuses?
            </p>

            <p>
                Do you know that Pam Beidle voted against guaranteed paid sick leave?
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>The truth is, no other Democratic delegation in Maryland
                has voted with Republican majorities more frequently than the delegates
                from District 32 — and it's not even close.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                Our delegation has consistently been on the wrong side of social and economic issues,
                and they do not serve the needs of our community nor represent the values of our party.
            </p>

            <p>
                It's time to stand up and demand change.
            </p>

            <p>
                I will always fight for our friends, families, neighbors, and community.<br>
                I will fight to make our government work for the people, not around them.<br>
                I will fight for a free and open society where all children are given
                the opportunity to realize their dreams, where our environment and future
                is protected, and where all people are given the same respect and opportunity,
                regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation.
            </p>
            <p>
                But I can't do it alone. Only together can we bring about real change.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>So remember to <a href="/join">join us</a>,
