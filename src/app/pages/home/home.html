        <h1>A Note From Derek</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                I've always believed that <strong>government is most effective when it is
                responsive to the needs of the community it represents</strong>. At its core,
                government is simply a community coming together to solve its
                collective problems for the benefit of the community as a whole.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a modern society, the sheer breadth of issues faced by
                our community is too vast for every citizen to remain informed
                on every issue, so we elect people from our community to serve
                as our representatives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now I don't mean to patronize you — we're all aware of the basic
                premise of how Democracy works. But I mention it to raise an
                important point.
            </p>
            <p>
                Government is only responsive to the needs of a community if
                the people we elect — the politicians — are responsive to the
                needs of our community as a whole. And it genuinely requires
                an altruistic and committed individual to maintain an open dialogue
                with their community and to represent their best interests —
                even when their constituents are too busy with their own lives
                to pay attention.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the past four years now, I have closely followed the actions
                and voting records of our elected Democratic representatives
                of District 32. <strong>What I've learned has shocked me.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Our representatives, who are all members of the
                <em>Democratic Party</em>, have not just voted for, but in many cases
                actually <em>sponsored bills</em> to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Send children to jail who haven't been convicted of a crime [HB196]</li>
                    <li>Take away a woman's right to choose [HB1312] [HB283]</li>
                    <li>Allow people to bring handguns into Maryland [HB464]</li>
                    <li>Allow people to purchase assault rifles [HB317]</li>
                    <li>Increase individual campaign contributions to $6000 [HB1499]</li>
                    <li>Give a tax break to the wealthy</li>
                </ul>
                They have also voted <em>against</em>:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Guaranteed Sick Leave for employees
                        <a href="http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmMain.aspx?pid=flrvotepage&tab=subject3&id=hb0580,h-0997&stab=02&ys=2016RS">[HB580]</a>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                In many cases these stances were in stark contrast to the majority
                of Democrats in the House, and aligned much more closely with
                Republican Delegates.
            </p>
            <p>
                I do not believe these positions are in line with the Democratic
                Party or with our community as a whole. That's why I've decided
                to submit my name to represent District 32 in the House of
                Delegates.
            </p>
            <p>
                I promise to engage with and represent our whole community
            </p>

                The United States is the most advanced, richest nation on the face of the Earth.
                And Maryland is the richest state in the Union.[1]
                Yet,
            </p>

            <cite>[1] Calculated by Median Household Income</cite>

            <p>
                Maryland legislatures recently voted to increase individual campaign
                contribution limits from $4,000 to $6,000 for State elections.
                Even Presidential campaigns are still limited to just $2,700.
                That's the wrong direction to be moving after the disasterous
                Citizen's United decision.
                <strong>In fact, in Maryland, Campaign Contribution Limits
                have been raising faster than the minimum wage.</strong>
                We need to get big money out of politics and get our priorities
                straight.

            <p>EPA's action level for lead in drinking water is 15 ppb; however,
            \"Rules and science are outdated. The E.P.A.’s trigger level for addressing lead in drinking water — 15 parts per billion — is not based on any health threat; rather, it reflects a calculation that water in at least nine in 10 homes susceptible to lead contamination will fall below that standard.\" (http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/09/us/regulatory-gaps-leave-unsafe-lead-levels-in-water-nationwide.html).

            <h2>Revitalize Baltimore</h2>

            <p>Baltimore's poorest neighborhoods are our neighbors. According to the Census Bureau (American Community Survey, 2012),
            25.2% of people in Baltimore live in poverty. 36.5% of children live in poverty. 84.9% of children receive their meals
            through the Free and Reduced Priced Meals Program. Neighborhoods in Baltimore have lower Life Expectancy rates
            lower than North Korea and the Gaza Strip. Growing up in these neighborhoods is a virtual death sentence.
            Those statistics alone should be enough to make it clear that we have a moral obligation to help our neighbors.
            But it is also in our own best interest to revitalize Baltimore and improve the quality of life for its
            residents.
            </p>
            <p>As Jordan Rappaport, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, observed:
            \"cities and suburbs depend on each other for economic growth\" and they
            \"grow or decline together\".
            </p>

            <p>$15 times 0 is still $0. Raising the minimum wage is important, but it's not enough. We also have to
            bring jobs in to the area that are going to stay and help the area grow.</p>
