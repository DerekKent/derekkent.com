        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <time class="last-update">Last Updated May 31, 2016</time>

        <p>
            Privacy is important. To show you that that's more than just an empty line,
            <strong>we've developed a privacy policy that goes above and beyond what is
            required by law</strong>. The below privacy policy applies only to
            resources served from DerekKent.com (\"this site\").
        </p>

        <div class="dnt-info">
            <h2>Are you tracking me?</h2>

            <if condition="model.optedOut">
                <div>
                    <span class="notice notice-green" key="opted-out">NO, you are not being tracked.</span>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Your browser has told us that you have asked to not be tracked.
                    Although web sites in the US do not have to (and indeed rarely do)
                    honor your settings, we do. <strong>We will not collect any information,
                    identifying or otherwise, about you, what pages you visit, or what
                    actions you take</strong> on this site, beyond the most basic of server logs.
                    We do not run any analytics on or share those logs with any third
                    parties, and we purge them after no more than 30 days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, no tracking cookies are installed or accessed, and we
                    have taken steps to prevent other third parties from tracking you
                    while you are on this site, including by disabling Google Analytics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The above only applies to pages you visit on this site with this
                    browser, and cannot be applied to other mediums, such as email
                    (see below for more details).
                </p>

                <h3>Can I opt in to tracking?</h3>

                <p>
                    Yes. If you would like to support our campaign by allowing us to
                    collect analytics on you while visiting this site, you can click
                    the \"Opt In\" button below. Data will be stored on your browser
                    that will only be used to remember and confirm this setting.

                        Your browser has indicated to us that you have specifically
                        chosen to opt in to tracking on this web site, even if

                    We are using Google Analytics to record information about this

                    Although we do not use or install any tracking cookies,
                    Google does install and read advertising cookies as a part of
                    Google Analytics that may be used to track you beyond this site.
                    You can opt out of having Google and other advertisers track you through
                    the use of online cookies on the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">
                    Network Advertising Initiative's Consumer opt-out page</a>.
                    Google also offers more fine-grained control of its own ads on its

                    you can click the \"Opt Out\" button below. Data will be stored on
