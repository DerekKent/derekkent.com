        <h1>Meet Derek</h1>

        <p>
            Derek Kent is a husband, father, veteran, engineer, and progressive leader who has been
            fighting for people's economic and civil rights his entire adult life.

        <p>
            Derek and his wife Phaby have settled their roots here in Maryland for the better part of the
            last decade, but have national and international experience confronting the challenges we face
            as a community â€” strengthening public education for all children, promoting healthy and
            sustainable growth, making our economy work for everyone, and advancing social justice.
        </p>

            Derek is a self-taught Software Engineer. He spent almost 5 years working with the non-profit
            organization OpenStax to help bring high-quality, free education materials to K-12 schools
            and universities. He now works on projects for US Cyber Command, helping protect our critical
            national infrastructure.

            In the aftermath of 9/11, Derek suspended his college education to enlist in the US Army.
            He served honorably in Kuwait and Iraq as a soldier, even while speaking out against
            the war in his capacity as a private citizen. He later attended the United States Military
            Academy at West Point and Syracuse University and holds a degree in International Relations
            and Chinese Language.
