            Transparency is a popular buzzword in politics today, but for all the
            emphasis it receives, we still seem to have <a href="/issues/corruption">as
            little say</a> in the legislative process as ever before.
        </p>

        <p>
            We can do much better.

        <h2>Direct Feedback on Issues that Matter</h2>

        <p>
            Advances in technology and mass communication now allow us to follow
            in real-time events from halfway around the world, yet our ability
            to connect with our own Local and State Representatives remains as
            anachronistic as it was half a century ago.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's time to start leveraging technology to change how we interact
            with Government and with our elected officials to start making it
            work for us, instead of around us.
        </p>

        <p>
            I will work with Open Government initiatives and new technological
            initiatives like <a href="http://opengovfoundation.org/projects/madison-project/">The Madison Project</a> to allow every citizen to engage with their government and express nuanced
            concerns and opinions every day — not just on a ballot once every two or four years.

        <h2>Open Meetings — Not Secret Ones</h2>

        <p>
            Some Legislators claim to be open and publish their calendars, but there's
            invariably large holes in their schedules that are filled with calls to
            donors and meetings with lobbyists.
        </p>

        <p>
            I will spend my time working for the people I represent — not to attract
            big donors. Furthermore, <strong>any and all meetings I have with registered lobbyists
            will be recorded in full and released to the public.</strong>
