        <h1>Evidence-based Policies</h1>

        <p>
            The concept of evidence-based policies has broad support across
            political lines and is widely supported by voters, yet implementation
            remains half-hearted at best.

        <p>
            In 2016, the General Assembly passed a $42 billion budget, but we have
            limited capacity to evaluate the effectiveness of that spending.
        </p>

        <p>
            Agencies are asked to submit a <a href="http://dbm.maryland.gov/budget/Documents/operbudget/2017-instructions/sect4-03.pdf">Performance Discussion</a> on the past year;
            however, the requirements for the findings and data are left largely
            to the agency's discretion, and are not required to be scientifically
            rigorous.
        </p>

        <p>
            Instead, spending is often driven by idealogical beliefs, and data is found
            to support whatever side of the argument one prefers.
        </p>

        <p>
            Requirements for scientifically valid evidence should be built into
            performance standards.
        </p>

        <h2>Require Agencies to Justify Funding Requests with Research</h2>

        <p>
            Gradually phase in requirements that agencies justify requests
            for additional resources with evidence that additional resources would
            produce positive results.
        </p>

        <h2>Embed Evidence Requirements in Agency Contracts</h2>

        <p>
            Contract processes should incentivize research and evidence-based programs
            by either mandating programs include an evidence-based model and oversight,
            or by giving preference to programs that do.
        </p>

        <h2>End Funding for Ineffective Programs</h2>

        <p>
            Programs that fail to meet specified goals should have their funding
            reduced or ended in order to allow for increased funding on programs
            that do work or to save taxpayers money.
