        <h1>Money in Politics</h1>

        <blockquote class="issue">
            Our country is now taking so steady a course as to show by what road it will pass to destruction, to wit: by consolidation of power first, and then corruption, its necessary consequence.<br>

        <p>
            Do you know the maximum individual donation for a State or Local
            candidate in Maryland is <strong>$6000</strong>? That's more than double what you
            can donate to someone running for President, and <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/documents/legismgt/elect/ContributionLimitstoCandidates2015-2016.pdf">ranks among the highest
            in the country</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            That means only a small handful of people can fully fund a campaign
            for State Legislature, County Council, or any other elected position,
            making it cheap and legal to buy influence over our elected officials —
            yes, corruption is legal in Maryland.

        <h2>Get Big Money Out of Politics</h2>

        <p>
            Campaigns should be reliant on building broad support among their
            constituents, not on building narrow support among a small group of
            wealthy donors.
        </p>

        <p>
            The maximum individual contribution should be reduced from its currently
            ludicrous amount of $6000 down to $575 for a statewide candidate and $200
            for a local or legislative candidate. Additionally, donations to campaigns
            from corporations should be prohibited.
        </p>

        <p>
            That would put our contribution limits in line with some of the lowest
            in the country, matching Colorado.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, Maryland also has a role to play in getting money out of politics at
            the national level. By <a href="http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2015RS/bills/sj/sj0002t.pdf">calling
            for an amendments convention</a> under Article V of the Constitution to reserve
            political rights to natural persons (not corporations) and authorizing the
            regulation of campaign contributions and electioneering spending, we can help
            bring about the end of big money's corrupting influence at all levels of government.
        </p>

        <h2>Fair Elections</h2>

        <p>
            Too often, \"campaigning\" today doesn't mean engaging with the public,
            it means meeting with and calling large donors to ask for money. And
            those meetings don't begin when you start seeing political ads — they've
            been out <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/01/14/the-most-depressing-graphic-for-members-of-congress/">raising money four or more hours a day</a>,
            every day, for their entire term in office.
        </p>

        <p>
            When election season gets close, elected officials commonly spend
            70 to 80 percent of their time just asking for money.
        </p>

        <p>
            The reason they do so is simple — it works. The campaign that raises the
            most money tends to win, it's that simple.
        </p>

        <p>
            We need to break that cycle by decreasing the emphasis on large donors
            and shifting it instead to small donors.
        </p>

        <p>
            Reducing maximum campaign contribution limits is an important step, but
            we can also <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/howard/columbia/ph-ho-cf-citizen-funded-campaign-launch-0818-20160817-story.html">amplify the
            power of small donors</a> by providing matching public financing for campaigns
            that agree to keep spending under a given cap for their race.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Elections should be about ideas, not fundraising.</strong>
