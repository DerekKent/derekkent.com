        <h2>Free Public College</h2>

        <p>
            A college education has immense benefits for individuals and for
            society as a whole. Students who graduate from college on average
            earn significantly higher incomes, contribute more in taxes
            back to their communities, and even <a href="https://www.luminafoundation.org/files/resources/its-not-just-the-money.pdf">live longer and are happier</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            But despite the huge economic advantages that communities reap
            from having a high percentage of college graduates, we are
            increasingly putting more and more of the burden of paying
            for college on our children.

        <p>
            Home ownership has been falling among Millennials over the past
            decade while <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2016/05/18/hopes-dreams-debt/fR60cKakwUlGok0jTlONTN/story.html">student debt has more than tripled</a>
            to $1.23 trillion over the same time period.
        </p>

        <p>
            Young people today spend <a href="http://studentdebtcrisis.org/young-people-spend-one-fifth-income-student-loan-payments/">20% of
            their income on repaying student loans</a>, and 60% of Millennials
            now expect to be paying back student loans well into their 40s.
        </p>

        <p>
            This situation is creating a long-term cost both for millions of young
            people, as well as for our entire economy. Student loans are draining
            new workers of disposable income, causing them to spend less,
            and cutting off the most important driver of growth.
        </p>

        <p>
            In a highly competitive global economy, we cannot afford to not have
            the best educated workforce in the world.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is long past time to make public college in Maryland tuition free
            for any student graduating from a Maryland High School.
        </p>

        <h2>School Funding</h2>

        <p>
            The Bridge to Excellence in Public Schools Act, passed in 2002, has
            helped provide historic levels of funding to public schools here in Maryland,
            and helped turn our public education system into one of the best in
            the country.
        </p>

        <p>
            It should be no surprise that States that invest more in education
            have better schools and produce better results, but new studies have
            shown that <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w20118">there is significant
            return on investment that benefits the entire community</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Despite the successes though, Maryland ranks near the bottom of all states
            for funding poor districts and affluent districts evenly. In order to
            address this gap, the General Assembly created the <a href="http://www.marylandeducators.org/sites/default/files/docs/ms-060-white-paper-2016_r2.1.pdf">Thornton II Commission</a>,
            which will recommend a new funding formula by the 2018 General Assembly session.
        </p>

        <p>
            The recommendations of the Thornton II Commission should be adopted
            if they make our school funding more equitable. Furthermore, we should
            increase our education funding so that no district sees its funding
            decrease due to the new formula, but rather we bring all districts
            up to the same levels of funding and excellence that our best
            schools currently enjoy.
