        <h1>Universal Health Insurance</h1>

        <p>
            Medical bills are the leading cause of bankruptcy in the United
            States, outnumbering <em>all other causes combined</em>. More than
            25% of all adults have said that <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/03/08/468892489/medical-bills-still-take-a-big-toll-even-with-insurance">health care costs have caused a
            serious financial problem</a>. Additionally, 240,000 Marylanders still lack
            any type of health insurance.
        </p>

        <p>
            Universal Health<em>care</em> would be the ideal solution to health care;
            however, as Colorado's <a href="http://www.coloradoindependent.com/162305/coloradocare-amendment-69">brief flirtation</a> with ColoradoCare showed, implementing universal healthcare
            at the state level comes with additional complications that can only
            be avoided by implementing it at a national level.
        </p>

        <p>
            Universal Health <em>Insurance</em>, on the other hand, is a much more
            manageable step that would be relatively inexpensive to implement,
            but would help to reduce the number of bankruptcies due to medical bills â€”
            and make Maryland the first state to provide 100% of residents at least
            some level of health care coverage.
        </p>

        <p>
            By providing all Marylander's with Catastrophic Health Insurance, we can
            provide full coverage for anyone whose health care costs exceed a percentage
            of their incomes.
        </p>

        <p>
            Employer-provided insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, and plans
            bought through the Maryland Health Connection would continue to be the norm
            for everyday medical expenditures, but unexpected and unpredictable
            health care costs would no longer leave families with impossible-to-pay
            medical bills.
