        <h1>Universal Health Care</h1>

            America's health care system is neither healthy, caring, nor a system.<br>

        <p>
            Health care is not a luxury, it is a basic human right.
        </p>

        <p>
            Under a single-payer health care plan, every Maryland resident would
            be entitled to decent health care without the need to pay premiums,
            deductibles, or copays.
        </p>

        <p>
            Such a plan would provide more equitable access to health care for
            families and businesses while at the same time helping to <a href="http://www.pnhp.org/facts/singlepayer_myths_singlepayer_facts.php">save billions
            of dollars</a> due to the administrative waste in our current system.
        </p>

        <p>
            This isn't theoretical either — we already know single-payer works.
            The United States is the only major country that fails to provide
            or guarantee a right to health care. And yet the United States also
            manages to spend far more on health care than other developed nations.

            While the Trump administration and Congressional Republicans continue
            to attack our health care system in order to provide massive tax
            cuts to the rich, Maryland can go in a different direction and join
            the rest of the developed world in recognizing health care as a basic
            human right.
