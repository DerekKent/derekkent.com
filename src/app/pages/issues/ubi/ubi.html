        <h1>Universal Basic Income</h1>

        <p>
            Many names have been given to the idea — Universal Basic Income, Negative Income Tax, Citizen's Wage — the idea is not a new one, but it is an idea whose time has come.
        </p>

        <p>
            In his final book, <cite>Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?</cite>, Martin Luther King, Jr. made a powerful case for a guaranteed income:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                I am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective — the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed measure: the guaranteed income.
            </p>

            <p>
                Earlier in this century this proposal would have been greeted with ridicule and denunciation as destructive of initiative and responsibility. At that time economic status was considered the measure of the individual's abilities and talents. In the simplistic thinking of that day the absence of worldly goods indicated a want of industrious habits and moral fiber.
            </p>

            <p>
                We have come a long way in our understanding of human motivation and of the blind operation of our economic system. Now we realize that dislocations in the market operation of our economy and the prevalence of discrimination thrust people into idleness and bind them in constant or frequent unemployment against their will. The poor are less often dismissed from our conscience today by being branded as inferior and incompetent. We also know that no matter how dynamically the economy develops and expands it does not eliminate all poverty.
            </p>
            <p>[...]</p>
            <p>
                The problem indicates that our emphasis must be two-fold. We must create full employment or we must create incomes. People must be made consumers by one method or the other. Once they are placed in this position, we need to be concerned that the potential of the individual is not wasted. New forms of work that enhance the social good will have to be devised for those for whom traditional jobs are not available.

            The idea of a Universal Basic Income has been endorsed by numerous Nobel laureates in Economics, including Milton Friedman, Paul Samuelson, and James Tobin, as well as a veritable army of other well-respected economists. It's an idea that has seen support across the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/08/why-arent-reformicons-pushing-a-guaranteed-basic-income/375600/">political</a> and <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-guaranteed-income-for-every-american-1464969586">ideological</a> spectrum, famously <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/05/richard-nixon-ubi-basic-income-welfare/">nearly becoming a reality under President Richard Nixon</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>The idea is so simple as to almost be absurd: to eliminate poverty, give people money.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            In the United States today, we spend hundreds of billions of dollars to try to prevent poverty, and yet <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2015/demo/p60-252.pdf">1 in 7 Americans</a> and 1 in 5 children still live in poverty. Millions of people in the United States survive on less than $2/day.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here in Anne Arundel County, we live in one of the wealthiest counties in the wealthiest State in the wealthiest Country in the History of humanity, and yet <a href="http://www.catholiccharities-md.org/public-policy/2014-map-poverty-profiles.pdf">7.1 percent of children still live below the poverty line</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            And as technology continues to reduce the labor requirements for jobs across all sectors of our economy and we find ourselves with more and more people not participating in the job market, even as we continue to produce more and more wealth, the numbers above are likely to only get worse.

            We can do better, and we must do better. It is both a moral imperative and simply good economic and political sense to invest now in finding <a href="/issues/policy">scientifically proven methods</a> of eliminating poverty and protecting Americans from market disruptions due to technological advancement.
        </p>

        <p>
            As the wealthiest State in the Union, I believe Maryland can and should be a leader in researching and implementing such a solution.
