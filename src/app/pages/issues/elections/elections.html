        <h2>Automatic Voter Registration</h2>

        <p>
            Since 2015, five States have already enacted automatic voter registration for
            all citizens who interact with a government agency — unless they decline — and
            29 States plus the District of Columbia have recently considered such measures.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here in Maryland, the Senate killed an automatic voter registration bill in 2016,
            but we should continue to support the Universal Voter Registration Act proposed
            by Senator Roger Manno, or similar legislation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Every citizen has a right to vote, and government should continue to work
            to ensure that right.
        </p>

        <h2>Election Day Off</h2>

        <p>
            Election Day is already a State Holiday in Maryland, although you'd be forgiven for not
            knowing — few companies give employees any time off, let alone the entire day, to
            exercise their Constitutional Right to participate in our elections.
        </p>

        <p>
            Employers should be required to give workers time off to vote, and employees should be
            paid if they have to vote during their normal working hours. As compensation,
            employers should be able to claim such wages as a tax write-off.
        </p>

        <h2>Open Primaries</h2>

        <p>
            Voters should be free to support any candidate they choose, regardless of how
            they may be registered.
        </p>

        <h2>Blockchain Voting</h2>

        <p>
            The <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/11/what-is-blockchain/">blockchain</a>
            has been exploding in popularity since the emergence of BitCoin in 2009. At its core,
            a blockchain is a ledger of records that is cryptographically validated as a chain going back
            in time, allowing anyone and everyone to maintain a copy and ensure its accuracy.
        </p>

        <p>
            Blockchains are so secure, they are now being <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/business/dealbook/central-banks-consider-bitcoins-technology-if-not-bitcoin.html">adopted by central banks around the world</a>, and have recently <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/european-parliament-document-suggests-future-of-democracy-linked-to-blockchain-enabled-e-voting-1475701523">gained the support of the European Parliament</a> for use in elections.
        </p>

        <p>
            Blockchains offer the possibility of truly secure and transparent voting over the Internet,
            eliminating long voting lines while simultaneously allowing anyone to verify the veracity of
            election results.
        </p>

        <p>
            As one of the wealthiest and most technologically advanced States in the Union, Maryland should be
            at the forefront of exploring the possibilities of blockchain voting.
        </p>

        <h2>Vote By Mail</h2>

        <p>
            In Maryland, anyone registered to vote can apply for an absentee ballot; however, in practice
            most voters are unaware of this right.
        </p>

        <p>
            We can do better — absentee ballots should be mailed to all voters prior to the election
            to give everyone the choice of submitting an absentee ballot.
        </p>

        <p>
            Several States already perform <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/all-mail-elections.aspx">all-mail elections</a>, and Maryland already sends a fake
            ballot to registered voters in advance. Sending a real ballot instead would require little
            effort, but have a huge impact on voter participation.
