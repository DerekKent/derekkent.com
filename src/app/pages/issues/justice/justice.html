        <h1>Criminal Justice Reform</h1>

            Where justice is denied, where poverty is enforced, where ignorance prevails, and where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, rob and degrade them, neither persons nor property will be safe.<br>

        <h2>Black Lives Matter</h2>

        <p>
            People who identify as black or African American make up about
            15.5% of the population in Anne Arundel County, <a href="http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2016/11/20/aclu-report-on-race-and-traffic-stops-in-maryland/">but they account
            for 29% of all traffic stops and 35% of police searches</a>.
        </p>

        <img src="/images/issues/justice/stop-and-search.png" alt="Blacks are 4 times more likely to be stopped and searched than whites">

        <p>
            In Maryland as a whole, a black person is almost 5 times more likely to be
            incarcerated than a white person.
        </p>

        <p>
            Communities that experience disproportionate incarceration rates
            <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/pcs_assets/2010/collateralcosts1pdf.pdf">suffer profound intergenerational consequences.
        </p>

        <p>
            Such drastically disproportionate results can only be the result
            of systemic issues in our economic and criminal justice systems,
            and it is both morally imperative and socially and economically sensible
            to end the rampant and destructive racism.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Unfortunately, our current District 32 delegates have repeatedly shown
            that they are unwilling to stand up for racial equality and justice.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            Delegates Mark Chang and Ted Sophocleus both <a href="http://openstates.org/md/votes/MDV00019608/">voted against</a> legislation that authorized people to have convictions which
            are no longer considered crimes to be expunged from their record — convictions
            that overwhelmingly targeted people of color. The legislation was so
            popular it passed unanimously in the Senate and was opposed by only two
            other Democrats in the entire House!
        </p>

        <p>
            All three of our delegates <a href="http://openstates.org/md/votes/MDV00020673/">voted
            against</a> reducing mandatory minimum sentencing for drug offenses — only 3 other
            Democrats in the House joined them in opposition (83 voted in favor).
        </p>

        <p>
            Delegates Chang and Sophocleus <a href="http://openstates.org/md/votes/MDV00020141/">voted
            against</a> returning voting rights to felons who served their time and were released —
            only 4 other Democrats in the House joined them.
        </p>

        <p>
            If our Delegates lack the courage to stand up for reform when it is
            overwhelmingly popular, how will they ever have the courage to stand
            up for the rights of all Marylanders when it isn't?
        </p>

        <h2>Judicial Reform</h2>

        <h3>Bail</h3>

        <p>
            $256 million. That's the amount of money that has been extracted from Maryland
            communities over a 5 year period in the form of non-refundable corporate bail bond premiums.
            Over that same time period, $181 million was paid by defendants who were black,
            while defendants of all other races combined paid $75 million.
        </p>

        <img src="/images/issues/justice/bail.png" alt="70% of all corporate bail bond premiums are paid by people of color">

        <p>
            Our cash bail system has resulted in a huge transfer of wealth from communities
            of color in Maryland to the billion-dollar bail bond industry.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, over the same time period, 46,597 defendants were detained
            for more than 5 days for a failure to pay bail. For at least 17,434 of those defendants,
            their bail was set at less than $5,000.
        </p>

        <p>
            Defendants who lack the funds to put up bail are faced with two options:
            remain in jail, unable to continue working or caring for their families, or pay the
            premiums demanded by the bail bond industry — 10% or more of their bail. If you must put
            up a $10,000 secured bond for bail, you will pay $1,000 or more — money that you will not
            get back, even if you are found to be completely innocent.
        </p>

        <p>
            Study after study has found that the key factor in determining if an individual is
            incarcerated while awaiting trial is not the risk they pose to society, nor is it
            the risk of them failing to appear in court. The number one factor is simply whether
            they have enough money to pay bail. Not only does bail not have an impact on whether
            or not a defendant returns to court, but it actually has been found to be the cause of
            new crime and is used to coerce convictions.
        </p>

        <p>
            The US Department of Justice and the American Bar Association have called pretrial
            detention systems that jail people simply because they are poor both irrational and
            unconstitutional.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's time to end permanently end the use of secured cash bail bonds in our justice system.
        </p>

        <h3>Public Defenders</h3>

        <p>
            Public Defenders juggle <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/investigations/bs-md-public-defender-caseloads-20160819-story.html">impossibly large case
            loads</a> as they are being asked to represent literally hundreds of clients beyond
            what legal experts say is possible to provide effective legal representation.
        </p>

        <p>
            The lack of Public Defenders puts people who can't afford legal representation
            at a significant disadvantage in our legal system, and all too often
            <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2014/11/20/why-innocent-people-plead-guilty/">leads
            to innocent people pleading guilty</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            We need to increase funding to immediately hire an additional 150 Public Defenders.
        </p>

        <h2>Law Enforcement Reform</h2>

        <h3>Uniform Code of Police Justice</h3>

        <p>
            With great power comes great responsibility. And the people we entrust with that
            power must be held to a higher standard than their fellow citizens.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the military, our soldiers are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice
            (UCMJ). While we honor their service, we recognize that there is a need for special
            obligations commensurate with the significant duties and responsibilities entrusted
            to our armed forces.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our law enforcement officers, like our military, have a special role to play and are
            similarly entrusted with great powers — including the use of deadly force. We need
            a counterpart to the UCMJ — a Uniform Code of Police Justice — to similarly hold
            those we entrust to defend our communities to a higher standard.
        </p>
