        <h1>Criminal Justice Reform</h1>

        <blockquote class="issue">
            Where justice is denied, where poverty is enforced, where ignorance prevails, and where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, rob and degrade them, neither persons nor property will be safe.<br>

        <h2>Black Lives Matter</h2>

        <p>
            People who identify as black or African American make up about
            15.5% of the population in Anne Arundel County, <a href="http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2016/11/20/aclu-report-on-race-and-traffic-stops-in-maryland/">but they account
            for 29% of all traffic stops and 35% of police searches</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            In Maryland, a black person is almost 5 times more likely to be
            incarcerated than a white person.
        </p>

        <img src="/images/issues/justice/incarceration-rates.jpg" alt="Incarceration rates by race in Maryland">

        <p>
            Communities that experience disproportionate incarceration rates
            <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/pcs_assets/2010/collateralcosts1pdf.pdf">suffer profound intergenerational consequences.
        </p>

        <p>
            Such drastically disproportionate results can only be the result
            of systemic issues in our economic and criminal justice systems,
            and it is both morally imperative and socially and economically sensible
            to end the rampant and destructive racism.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Unfortunately, our current District 32 delegates have repeatedly shown
            that they are unwilling to stand up for racial equality and justice.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            Delegates Mark Chang and Ted Sophocleus both <a href="http://openstates.org/md/votes/MDV00019608/">voted against</a> legislation that authorized people to have convictions which
            are longer considered crimes to be expunged from their record — convictions
            that overwhelmingly targeted people of color. The legislation was so
            popular it passed unanimously in the Senate and was opposed by only two
            other Democrats in the entire House!
        </p>

        <p>
            All three of our delegates <a href="http://openstates.org/md/votes/MDV00020673/">voted
            against</a> reducing mandatory minimum sentencing for drug offenses — only 3 other
            Democrats in the House joined them in opposition (83 voted in favor).
        </p>

        <p>
            Delegates Chang and Sophocleus <a href="http://openstates.org/md/votes/MDV00020141/">voted
            against</a> returning voting rights to felons who served their time and were released —
            only 4 other Democrats in the House joined them.
        </p>

        <p>
            If our Delegates lack the courage to stand up for reform when it is
            overwhelmingly popular, how will they ever have the courage to stand
            up for the rights of all Marylanders when it isn't?
        </p>

        <h2>Judicial Reform</h2>

        <h3>Bail</h3>

        <p>
            Bail plays a large but not well known role in mass incarceration in Maryland.
        </p>

        <p>
            Pretrial detainees make up roughly 20% of our prison population, and, as
            <a href="http://thedailyrecord.com/2016/11/17/bail-reform-symposium/">explained</a>
            by Maryland Public Defender Paul B. DeWolfe, \"In practice, amounts of [bail] money
            are (selected) randomly.\"
        </p>

        <p>
            Maryland judicial officers should be required to <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/oped/bs-ed-bail-rules-20161116-story.html">set bail prices at levels
            that defendants can reasonably afford</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Public Defenders</h3>

        <p>
            Public Defenders juggle <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/investigations/bs-md-public-defender-caseloads-20160819-story.html">impossibly large case
            loads</a> as they are being asked to represent literally hundreds of clients beyond
            what legal experts say is possible to provide effective legal representation.
        </p>

        <p>
            The lack of Public Defenders puts people who can't afford legal representation
            at a significant disadvantage in our legal system, and all too often
            <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2014/11/20/why-innocent-people-plead-guilty/">leads
            to innocent people pleading guilty</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            We need to increase funding to immediately hire an additional 150 Public Defenders.
        </p>

        <h2>Law Enforcement Reform</h2>

        <h3>Policing By Consent</h3>

        <p>
            American police forces have slowly moved away from the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peelian_principles">Peelian Principles</a> upon which they originally based their practices.
            These Principles are largely uncontroversial among the public at large:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    To recognize always that the power of the police to fulfill their functions and duties is dependent on public approval of their existence, actions and behavior, and on their ability to secure and maintain public respect.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To recognize always that to secure and maintain the respect and approval of the public means also the securing of the willing co-operation of the public in the task of securing observance of laws.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To recognize always that the extent to which the co-operation of the public can be secured diminishes proportionately the necessity of the use of physical force and compulsion for achieving police objectives.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To seek and preserve public favor, not by pandering to public opinion, but by constantly demonstrating absolutely impartial service to law, in complete independence of policy, and without regard to the justice or injustice of the substance of individual laws, by ready offering of individual service and friendship to all members of the public without regard to their wealth or social standing, by ready exercise of courtesy and friendly good humor, and by ready offering of individual sacrifice in protecting and preserving life.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To use physical force only when the exercise of persuasion, advice and warning is found to be insufficient to obtain public co-operation to an extent necessary to secure observance of law or to restore order, and to use only the minimum degree of physical force which is necessary on any particular occasion for achieving a police objective.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To maintain at all times a relationship with the public that gives reality to the historic tradition that the police are the public and that the public are the police, the police being only members of the public who are paid to give full-time attention to duties which are incumbent on every citizen in the interests of community welfare and existence.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To recognize always that the test of police efficiency is the absence of crime and disorder, and not the visible evidence of police action in dealing with them.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            The militarization of our police forces and the seemingly daily stream of videos
            showing excessive use of force by police are evidence that we have forgotten
            the above principles and ignored the consequences.
        </p>

        <p>
            We must work to demilitarize our police forces, increase training for police to
            emphasize deescalation, and create a force that internalizes the above principles.
        </p>
