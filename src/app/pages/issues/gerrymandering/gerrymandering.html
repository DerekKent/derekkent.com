        <h1>End Gerrymandering</h1>

        <blockquote>
            In America, politicians should not pick their voters; voters should pick their politicians.<br>

        <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering">Gerrymandering</a> is the
            \"art\" by which politicians draw district lines to reduce the political power
            of people who might disagree with them and to protect themselves and their political party.

        <p>
            Redistricting happens every 10 years, after the census, with the next census taking place
            in 2020. That means this election will determine who draws those lines, since both the State House and Senate in Maryland has 4 year terms.
        </p>

        <p>
            Nationally, gerrymandering was used to devastating effect by the Republican Party in 2010,
            allowing them unending control of the House of Representatives, even in multiple elections
            Democrats received substantially more votes.
        </p>

        <p>
            In Maryland, gerrymandering has been used to similar effect by Democrats.
        </p>

        <p>
            Although it has undeniably been to the benefit of my party here, I cannot support or condone
            playing political games with communities and our political process.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/05/15/americas-most-gerrymandered-congressional-districts/">worst gerrymandering in the entire country</a>
            happens right here in Maryland. We have completely undermined any moral authority
            Democrats in the rest of the country might have had to argue against similar actions
            in Republican-controlled States.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Fairness must be an underlying principle of our democratic system.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            I will fight to implement a plan <a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/citizens-don-t-gerrymandering-study-offers-alternative-redistricting-methods">similar to that pioneered in Iowa</a> (who has had a truly nonpartisan redistricting system since the 1960s).
        </p>

        <p>
            The Legislature would delegate redistricting to the nonpartisan <a href="http://dls.state.md.us">
            Department of Legislative Services</a>, which would be instructed to draw district lines taking into
            account only population and following as closely as possible existing county and city borders.
