        <h1>Women's Rights</h1>

            We ask justice, we ask equality, we ask that all the civil and political rights that belong to citizens of the United States, be guaranteed to us and our daughters forever.<br>

        <h2>Health Care</h2>

        <p>
            Donald Trump's victory in 2016 and the subsequent Supreme Court nominations
            he makes may put the health of millions of women and young girls at grave
            risk.
        </p>

        <p>
            Women may soon <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/11/10/13578550/trump-obamacare-birth-control-iuds">lose access to affordable preventive health care</a>, and their Right to choose
            may be taken away for the first time since 1973.
        </p>

        <p>
            A woman's medical decisions should be between her, her family, and her doctor,
            not politicians.
        </p>

        <p>
            Whatever happens at the national level, we must ensure that women in Maryland
            continue to have affordable access to preventive care and the best health care
            in the country, and that they always retain full control over their own bodies.
        </p>

        <h2>Equal Pay</h2>

        <p>
            The <a href="https://blog.dol.gov/2016/07/04/equal-pay-for-equal-work-in-maryland/">Equal Pay for Equal Work Act</a> went into effect in October 2016 and represents a significant step
            in ensuring pay equality and ending wage discrimination on the basis of gender.
        </p>

        <p>
            Significant work still remains though in eliminating the wage gap, including
            educating Marylanders about their rights, eliminating the taboo against
            discussing wages which only benefits employers, and working to close the wage gap
            for women of color in particular who have been most affected by wage
            discrimination.
