            American exceptionalism lies in the idea that peoples of every
            race, color, religion, and creed can come together to form a single,
            united State. Whether you carry a kirpan, face Mecca to pray, or wear
            a kippah, you possess a liberty of conscience and immunity of
            citizenship enjoyed by all Americans, regardless of faith.

            If this great experiment we call the United States is to succeed,
            toleration and compassion cannot be indulgences afforded to only some.

            The events of the past year, and indeed for most of this young millennium,
            have challenged our ideals and given a voice to the simplicity of
            bigotry and intolerance.
        </p>

        <p>
            We must all come together as a single united people to give bigotry no
            sanction and persecution no assistance. We must recognize that when
            our fellow citizens are threatened and terrorized, we are threatened
            and terrorized.
        </p>

        <p>
            For when we allow any freedom born of the individual liberty of conscience
            guaranteed by our Constitution to be undermined, we allow the idea of America
            itself to be undermined.
