        <h1>Minimum Wage</h1>

        <p>
            Maryland's minimum wage will reach $10.10 an hour in July 2018 â€” an
            improvement over the $8.25 it was in 2016, but still far short of
            a real livable wage.

            We live in the richest State in the Union, yet about 200,000 children in our
            State still live below the poverty line, while income inequality has been
            <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/Maryland.pdf">getting worse since the 1970s</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            We need to start by raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, but we also can't stop
            there and allow the minimum wage to stagnate for another 30 years.
        </p>

        <p>
            After bringing the minimum wage up to a real living wage, it should be indexed
            to inflation so that workers' real purchasing power is never again subjected to
            decades of decline.
