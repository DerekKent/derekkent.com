        <h1>Supporting Families</h1>

        <blockquote class="issue">
            In the richest country on earth, no one should force mothers to go back to work days or weeks after giving birth.<br>

        <h2>Paid Family Leave</h2>

        <p>
            Too many parents are forced to leave their babies to go back to work only
            days after they are born — a time that is critical both for new parents
            to gain confidence with their babies and for children to bond with their parents.
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/25/kirsten-gillibrand/yes-us-only-industrialized-nation-without-paid-fam/">Every other developed nation on Earth offers guaranteed paid leave</a>, because they recognize that supporting families
            isn't a luxury — it's an economic necessity.
        </p>

        <p>
            As the richest State in the wealthiest nation in the world, we can and should
            do much better. We can:
            <ul>
                <li>Guarantee 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, and</li>
                <li>Ensure paid leave matches at least two-thirds of pay, up to a ceiling</li>
            </ul>
            And we can do both at no additional cost on businesses by adapting Senator Gillibrand's
            <a href="https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov/issues/paid-family-medical-leave">FAMILY Act</a>
            to Maryland.
