        <h1>Clean Energy</h1>

        <p>
            Over half of Marylandâ€™s electricity still comes from fossil fuels like
            coal and natural gas. In Anne Arundel County, we have a 34-year old
            coal-fired power plant and a 62-year old predominantly coal and oil-fired
            power plant, both less than 5 miles east of Glen Bernie.
        </p>

        <p>
            Collectively, these plants consume approximately 4.8 <strong>million</strong> tons of
            coal annually, and they are a big reason why Anne Arundel County
            <a href="http://www.lung.org/our-initiatives/healthy-air/sota/city-rankings/states/maryland/">received
            an F for air quality from the American Lung Association</a>. The air
            we breathe every day is killing us, putting us \"at risk for premature death,
            aggravated asthma, difficulty breathing, cardiovascular harm and lower birth weight\".
        </p>

        <p>
            And that doesn't even begin to take into account the impact fossil fuels have
            on climate change and sea level rise, which Maryland is also particularly
            vulnerable to.
        </p>

        <p>
            We must do more now to shift our energy production to clean and
            renewable sources.

            The <a href="http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmMain.aspx?id=hb1106&stab=01&pid=billpage&tab=subject3&ys=2016RS">Clean Energy Jobs Act</a>
            is a great start. It would require Maryland to get 25% of its power
            from clean energy sources like wind and solar by 2020, but we can't
            stop there.
        </p>

        <p>
            Maryland has a wealth of potential wind energy available in the Chesapeake Bay
            that could supply the entire state with 67% of its energy needs using
            existing offshore wind power technology.
        </p>

        <p>
            A commitment to expanding our use of renewable energy to 40% by 2025
            would not just be good for the environment and our health, but would
            also create thousands of well-paying jobs right here in Anne Arundel
            County.
        </p>

        <p>
            Investing now in a renewable energy future just makes sense.
