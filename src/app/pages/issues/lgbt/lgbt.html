        <h1>LGBTQ Rights</h1>

            Somebody, your father or mine, should have told us that not many people have ever died of love.
            But multitudes have perished, and are perishing every hour — and in the oddest places! —
            for the lack of it.<br>
            — James Baldwin

        <p>
            The LGBTQ community in Maryland has recently won several new important rights, including
            the right to marry and the right to be free from gender identity discrimination
            in employment, housing, and public accommodations.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, much work still remains to secure those rights. LGBTQ Marylanders still face
            discrimination in health care, housing, employment, and public accommodations, and
            LGBTQ youth continue to face discrimination and harassment in schools and in foster care.
        </p>

        <p>
            I will always fight to ensure full equality in all aspects of life for all Marylanders,
            regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.
