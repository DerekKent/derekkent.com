        <h1>Ban Fracking</h1>

        <p>
            Fracking threatens the air we breathe and the water we drink. And the
            issue is not isolated to just Western Maryland — five different
            gas basins stretch across 19 different counties in Maryland, including
            the Taylorsville gas basin, which stretches across half of
            Anne Arundel County.
        </p>

        <p>
            The process of fracking involves injecting millions of gallons of
            chemicals into the ground to crack apart rock. The EPA has
            identified <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-03/documents/fracfocus_analysis_report_and_appendices_final_032015_508_0.pdf">692 different chemicals</a>
            which are used, including large quantities of hydrochloric acid and methanol,
            which can cause chemical burns, blindness, and even death.
        </p>

        <p>
            These chemicals can invariably end up contaminating drinking water
            and threatening the health of entire communities. But the threat is not
            only to our water supply, but to our air as well. Research has now <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/fracking-air-pollution-IB.pdf">linked fracking to unhealthy
            levels of smog and toxic air contaminants</a> as well. Exposure can
            cause respiratory illnesses, central nervous system damage, birth defects,
            cancer, and even premature death.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2015, a temporary moratorium was placed on fracking, but that
            moratorium is set to expire in October 2017 unless the General
            Assembly acts now to extend it or permanently ban fracking in our state.
        </p>

        <p>
            Risking the health and well-being of communities across Maryland just to
            pump more climate-changing chemicals into the atmosphere makes no sense.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's keep fracking out of our state and focus on building a vibrant
            renewable energy economy that can sustain well-paying jobs indefinitely.
