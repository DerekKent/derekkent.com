        <h1>Accessibility Statement</h1>

        <p>We want everyone who visits the Derek Kent for Maryland District 32 website to feel welcome.</p>

        <h2>What are we doing?</h2>

        <p>To help us make the Derek Kent for Maryland District 32 website a positive place for everyone, we've been using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</a>. These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities, and user friendly for everyone.</p>

        <p>The guidelines have three levels of accessibility (A, AA and AAA). We’ve chosen to target most Level AAA criteria for the Derek Kent for Maryland District 32 website, with some exceptions noted below.</p>

        <h2>Toggle Accessibility Level</h2>

        <p>If you prefer a version of this site using enhanced contrast for improved accessibility, you can enable it below. This site is fully WCAG2 A accessible by default. Selecting AA or AAA will increase the contrast of all colors used on this site, with AAA providing the greatest contrast.</p>

        <ul class="accessibility-level">
            <li class="btn btn-large btn-serenity">A</li>
            <li class="btn btn-large btn-harebell">AA</li>
            <li class="btn btn-large btn-blue">AAA</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How are we doing?</h2>

        <p>We’re working hard to achieve our goal of Level AAA accessibility, but we realize there are some criteria we are unable to meet at this time. The following information explains what AA and AAA criteria we do not support by default, and what we have done to provide alternative solutions.</p>

        <h3>Success Criteria 1.2.6:</h3>

        <p>We are not in control of all audio and video content on this site and are unable to provide sign language interpretation of prerecorded audio at this time. We do however only select video content that provides closed captioning, as required by success criteria 1.2.2. We understand though that this is not always an adequate solution and apologize for any inconvenience.</p>

        <h3>Success Criteria 1.4.3:</h3>

        <p>Most of this site meets color contrast requirements for AA accessibility, with some exceptions. If you require full AA color contrast accessibility, enable the AA-compliant version of this site using the controls in the \"Toggle Accessibility Level\" section above.</p>

        <h3>Success Criteria 1.4.6:</h3>

        <p>Most content on this site meets color contrast requirements for AAA accessibility, with some exceptions. If you require full AAA color contrast accessibility, enable the AAA-compliant version of this site using the controls in the \"Toggle Accessibility Level\" section above.</p>
