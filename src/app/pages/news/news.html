            <h2>On Justice and Equality</h2>
            <time datetime="2018-01-15">Jan. 15, 2018</time>

            <p>
                “The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Martin Luther King Jr. spoke those words in the last speech he ever gave. He almost seemed aware that his life would soon end, but he nevertheless felt compelled to continue to speak out for justice and equality.
            </p>

            <p>
                Those words assuredly still hold true today as well, and serve as a beacon of veracity and a challenge to every person — man and woman — to come together in solidarity and to resist the voices that would seek to have us judge our neighbors by the color of their skin, rather than the content of their character.
            </p>

            <p>
                As we continue to struggle though, we must also recognize that no collection of marches, speeches, or elections will bring us the justice and equality we seek alone, because justice and equality must also mean economic justice and economic equality. Economic power buys political power. And political power buys justice.
            </p>

            <p>
                In his final book, Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?, Martin Luther King Jr. made a powerful case for the need for economic justice:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    We have come a long way in our understanding of human motivation and of the blind operation of our economic system. Now we realize that dislocations in the market operation of our economy and the prevalence of discrimination thrust people into idleness and bind them in constant or frequent unemployment against their will.
                </p>

                <p>
                    […]
                </p>

                <p>
                    The problem indicates that our emphasis must be two-fold. We must create full employment or we must create incomes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    […]
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective — the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed measure: the guaranteed income.
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                The racism today that represses people of color is even more insidious than the overtly racist laws that proceeded. It is a systemic racism that mercilessly represses, while simultaneously allowing people to pretend it doesn’t exist.
            </p>

            <p>
                It’s the reason why a young black man or woman born into poverty is likely to remain in poverty their entire life.
            </p>

            <p>
                When you are missing weeks of school because the heater broke due to lack of investment in schools in your community, you fall behind. When money is taken out of public schools so that wealthy families can get a discount sending their kids to private schools, you fall behind. And when you as a community fall behind, you are deprived of the political power necessary to deal with those and every interconnected issue, from policing and the legal system to local and state politics, to health care and employment.
            </p>

            <p>
                This year is the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.’s death, yet we are no closer to implementing the guaranteed income he called for than we were in 1967 when his final book was published.
            </p>

            <p>
                It’s time for that to change. We are the wealthiest state in the wealthiest country in the history of the world. Our GDP is nearly 4 times greater than it was 50 years ago. And yet our income gap continues to grow, poverty continues to be used as a tool of repression, and our middle class continues to shrink.
            </p>

            <p>
                So I ask you, when you’re out marching today, don’t just march to resist racial injustice or the vile rhetoric emanating from the White House. March to resist the economic injustice that enables and fuels it too.
            </p>

            <p>
                And let’s start demanding our elected officials stop patting themselves on the back for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and start demanding they take bold action today to bring us closer to the dream that Martin Luther King Jr. shared with us over half a century ago.

            <h2>Run for Something Endorses Derek Kent</h2>
            <time datetime="2016-11-17">Aug. 11, 2017</time>

            <p>
                <span class="location"><span class="city">Hanover</span>, Md.</span> –
                Run for Something, the group formed in the wake of the 2016 election
                to recruit progressive Millennials to run for local offices, announced
                its endorsement for Derek Kent and 64 other candidates from 18 states
                today.
            </p>

            <p>
                Derek is running to represent District 32 in Maryland's House of Delegates.
            </p>

            <p>
                “Our goal is to get people to run good campaigns all across the country,
                so we’re looking for people who have an idea how to get from A to Z,”
                said Amanda Litman, Run for Something's co-founder and veteran of
                election campaigns for Barack Obama, Charlie Crist, and Hillary Clinton.
            </p>

            <p>
                Run for Something was founded by Litman and Ross Morales Rocketto, but
                was quickly joined by other experienced political operatives, including
                Cristobal Alex, President of the Latino Victory Fund; Sabrina Hersi
                Issa, CEO of Be Bold Media; Aneesa McMillan, Deputy Communications
                Director for Keith Ellison for DNC Chair; and Charles Olivier, CFO of
                the Democratic National Committee.
            </p>

            <p>
                “No single individual makes a movement, but every movement is made of
                countless individuals standing together to make a difference,” said
                Derek. “Right now, we are in the midst of a political movement in this
                country to reaffirm the basic human rights of all members of our society,
                and to make our political system responsive to the citizenry it represents.
                The work that Run for Something does to support progressive young voices is
                critical to ensuring the success and longevity of this movement, and I am
                proud to have their support and to stand with them in this moment.”

            <h2>2017 General Assembly Session Review</h2>
            <time datetime="2017-04-12">April 12, 2017</time>

            <p>
                The 437th session of the General Assembly has now wrapped up,
                providing some important wins for Marylanders, mixed with a couple
                frustrating defeats and a deafening silence on much needed changes
                to ensure that everyone benefits from a growing economy and that
                every person is treated equally under the law.
            </p>

            <p>
                A permanent ban on fracking (HB1325), efforts to combat heroin
                addictions (HB1329 — the HOPE Act, and HB1082 — Start Talking Maryland Act),
                guaranteed paid sick leave (HB1 — Maryland Healthy Working Families Act),
                and a prohibition on generic drug price gouging (HB631) all represent
                important, positive changes that are beneficial to northern Anne Arundel
                County and all Marylanders.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a state, we also took important steps to resist some of the worst
                impulses of the Trump administration, such as empowering the Attorney
                General to sue the federal government. Funding for Planned Parenthood
                is now also guaranteed — no thanks to Delegates Chang and Sophocleus
                though, who both voted against HB1083.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unfortunately, HB1362 (the Trust Act) fell 2 votes shy of a veto-proof
                majority in the House (with 2 Delegates from District 32, Mark Chang
                and Ted Sophocleus, voting against it) and failed to get a floor vote
                in the Senate.
            </p>

            <p>
                Efforts to end Maryland's cash bail system achieved mixed results during
                the session, with legislation attempting to end the practice ultimately
                being pulled and the bail bond industry very nearly forcing through a bill
                (SB983) to restore the system after the Maryland Court of Appeals ruled
                that defendants cannot be held in jail simply because they can't afford bail.
                Continued vigilance next session will be necessary to ensure reforms here
                are not overturned.
            </p>

            <p>
                Legislators on both sides of the isle also patted themselves on the back
                for passing large tax breaks for big businesses under the flawed belief
                that it will attract meaningful manufacturing jobs to the state. Senator
                Manno, the lone Senator to vote against the bill, called it “a steak dinner
                for big business and a chicken box for the workers” — an assessment that
                will likely prove to be true.
            </p>

            <p>
                Much more needs to be done to tackle economic disparity and poverty in our
                state in a materially consequential way. That includes exploring a universal
                basic income or citizen's wage to raise families out of poverty and spur
                economic activity, providing a tuition-free college education at our state
                colleges and universities to help our young people realize a brighter future,
                and guaranteeing that no Marylander is saddled with crippling debt due to
                unmanageable health care costs. These initiatives will collectively do far
                more to stimulate and grow our economy.
            </p>

            <p>
                I look forward to working with you in 2018 to hold our elected officials
                accountable and to ensure that they represent the interests of the
                residents of District 32.

            </p>

            <p>
                Mark Chang even echoed Trump's rhetoric when he said “we need

            <h2>Tell Democracy for America to Endorse Derek</h2>
            <time datetime="2017-01-18">Jan. 18, 2017</time>

            <p>
                Democracy for America is considering endorsing Derek Kent for
                the District 32 primary, but they need to <a href="https://www2.democracyforamerica.com/endorsement_applicants/702-friends-of-derek-kent">hear from supporters
                like you</a>!
            </p>

            <p>
                Democracy for America is a grassroots, member-driven political action
                committee that works to get progressive leaders like Derek elected.
                Every endorsement they make is informed by individuals like you, not
                a select group of wealthy donors.
            </p>

            <p>
                It only takes a few seconds to <a href="https://www2.democracyforamerica.com/endorsement_applicants/702-friends-of-derek-kent">add your name</a>,
                but it could make a huge difference.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let's not go another four years without a strong voice from Anne Arundel
                County speaking up for a middle class that has been continuously eroded
                for decades while the very wealthiest members of society become even
                wealthier.

            <h2>Derek Kent Elected to District 32 Executive Board</h2>
            <time datetime="2016-11-17">Nov. 17, 2016</time>

            <p>
                <span class="location"><span class="city">Ferndale</span>, Md.</span> –
                Derek Kent on Thursday was one of 13 people nominated and elected to
                the District 32 Democratic Executive Board.
            </p>

            <p>
                Kent spoke after his election about the need for Democrats to reconnect
                with their base.
            </p>

            <p>
                “The election of Donald Trump has been a shock to people around
                the country and around the world, and has shown that Democrats cannot
                continue to pander to corporations and large donors at the expense
                of hard-working Americans, nor can we take for granted the support
                of laborers, unions, and young voters,” Kent said. “We must reconnect
                to voters with bold policies that give them something to vote for,
                not just against.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Kent is also running to represent District 32 in Maryland's House of
                Delegates in 2018.
