            <h2>Run for Something Endorses Derek Kent</h2>
            <time datetime="2016-11-17">Aug. 11, 2017</time>

            <p>
                <span class="location"><span class="city">Hanover</span>, Md.</span> –
                Run for Something, the group formed in the wake of the 2016 election
                to recruit progressive Millennials to run for local offices, announced
                its endorsement for Derek Kent and 64 other candidates from 18 states
                today.
            </p>

            <p>
                Derek is running to represent District 32 in Maryland's House of Delegates.
            </p>

            <p>
                “Our goal is to get people to run good campaigns all across the country,
                so we’re looking for people who have an idea how to get from A to Z,”
                said Amanda Litman, Run for Something's co-founder and veteran of
                election campaigns for Barack Obama, Charlie Crist, and Hillary Clinton.
            </p>

            <p>
                Run for Something was founded by Litman and Ross Morales Rocketto, but
                was quickly joined by other experienced political operatives, including
                Cristobal Alex, President of the Latino Victory Fund; Sabrina Hersi
                Issa, CEO of Be Bold Media; Aneesa McMillan, Deputy Communications
                Director for Keith Ellison for DNC Chair; and Charles Olivier, CFO of
                the Democratic National Committee.
            </p>

            <p>
                “No single individual makes a movement, but every movement is made of
                countless individuals standing together to make a difference,” said
                Derek. “Right now, we are in the midst of a political movement in this
                country to reaffirm the basic human rights of all members of our society,
                and to make our political system responsive to the citizenry it represents.
                The work that Run for Something does to support progressive young voices is
                critical to ensuring the success and longevity of this movement, and I am
                proud to have their support and to stand with them in this moment.”

            <h2>2017 General Assembly Session Review</h2>
            <time datetime="2017-04-12">April 12, 2017</time>

            <p>
                The 437th session of the General Assembly has now wrapped up,
                providing some important wins for Marylanders, mixed with a couple
                frustrating defeats and a deafening silence on much needed changes
                to ensure that everyone benefits from a growing economy and that
                every person is treated equally under the law.
            </p>

            <p>
                A permanent ban on fracking (HB1325), efforts to combat heroin
                addictions (HB1329 — the HOPE Act, and HB1082 — Start Talking Maryland Act),
                guaranteed paid sick leave (HB1 — Maryland Healthy Working Families Act),
                and a prohibition on generic drug price gouging (HB631) all represent
                important, positive changes that are beneficial to northern Anne Arundel
                County and all Marylanders.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a state, we also took important steps to resist some of the worst
                impulses of the Trump administration, such as empowering the Attorney
                General to sue the federal government. Funding for Planned Parenthood
                is now also guaranteed — no thanks to Delegates Chang and Sophocleus
                though, who both voted against HB1083.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unfortunately, HB1362 (the Trust Act) fell 2 votes shy of a veto-proof
                majority in the House (with 2 Delegates from District 32, Mark Chang
                and Ted Sophocleus, voting against it) and failed to get a floor vote
                in the Senate.
            </p>

            <p>
                Efforts to end Maryland's cash bail system achieved mixed results during
                the session, with legislation attempting to end the practice ultimately
                being pulled and the bail bond industry very nearly forcing through a bill
                (SB983) to restore the system after the Maryland Court of Appeals ruled
                that defendants cannot be held in jail simply because they can't afford bail.
                Continued vigilance next session will be necessary to ensure reforms here
                are not overturned.
            </p>

            <p>
                Legislators on both sides of the isle also patted themselves on the back
                for passing large tax breaks for big businesses under the flawed belief
                that it will attract meaningful manufacturing jobs to the state. Senator
                Manno, the lone Senator to vote against the bill, called it “a steak dinner
                for big business and a chicken box for the workers” — an assessment that
                will likely prove to be true.
            </p>

            <p>
                Much more needs to be done to tackle economic disparity and poverty in our
                state in a materially consequential way. That includes exploring a universal
                basic income or citizen's wage to raise families out of poverty and spur
                economic activity, providing a tuition-free college education at our state
                colleges and universities to help our young people realize a brighter future,
                and guaranteeing that no Marylander is saddled with crippling debt due to
                unmanageable health care costs. These initiatives will collectively do far
                more to stimulate and grow our economy.
            </p>

            <p>
                I look forward to working with you in 2018 to hold our elected officials
                accountable and to ensure that they represent the interests of the
                residents of District 32.

            <h2>Resist Trump and the AAC Dems Supporting Him</h2>
            <time datetime="2017-03-26">March 26, 2017</time>

                Did you see the <a href="http://www.capitalgazette.com/news/general_assembly/ph-ac-cn-north-county-dems-0325-20170324-story.html">Capital Gazette article</a>
                on Friday about the three Anne Arundel County Democrats who joined
                with Republicans to defend Trump's immigration policies?
            </p>

            <p>
                Mark Chang even echoed Trump's rhetoric when he said “we need
                to be able to have all law enforcement officers work together in
                <em>dealing with bad elements</em>.”
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>We need Democrats in Annapolis who will stand up to Trump
                and resist his xenophobic and racist policies.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                Can you pitch in $35 today to help defeat Mark Chang and the
                other pro-Trump Democrats?

            <h2>Tell Democracy for America to Endorse Derek</h2>
            <time datetime="2017-01-18">Jan. 18, 2017</time>

            <p>
                Democracy for America is considering endorsing Derek Kent for
                the District 32 primary, but they need to <a href="https://www2.democracyforamerica.com/endorsement_applicants/702-friends-of-derek-kent">hear from supporters
                like you</a>!
            </p>

            <p>
                Democracy for America is a grassroots, member-driven political action
                committee that works to get progressive leaders like Derek elected.
                Every endorsement they make is informed by individuals like you, not
                a select group of wealthy donors.
            </p>

            <p>
                It only takes a few seconds to <a href="https://www2.democracyforamerica.com/endorsement_applicants/702-friends-of-derek-kent">add your name</a>,
                but it could make a huge difference.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let's not go another four years without a strong voice from Anne Arundel
                County speaking up for a middle class that has been continuously eroded
                for decades while the very wealthiest members of society become even
                wealthier.
            </p>

                <a href="https://www2.democracyforamerica.com/endorsement_applicants/702-friends-of-derek-kent">Voice your support</a> now, and together we can make our government work

            <h2>Derek Kent Elected to District 32 Executive Board</h2>
            <time datetime="2016-11-17">Nov. 17, 2016</time>

            <p>
                <span class="location"><span class="city">Ferndale</span>, Md.</span> –
                Derek Kent on Thursday was one of 13 people nominated and elected to
                the District 32 Democratic Executive Board.
            </p>

            <p>
                Kent spoke after his election about the need for Democrats to reconnect
                with their base.
            </p>

            <p>
                “The election of Donald Trump has been a shock to people around
                the country and around the world, and has shown that Democrats cannot
                continue to pander to corporations and large donors at the expense
                of hard-working Americans, nor can we take for granted the support
                of laborers, unions, and young voters,” Kent said. “We must reconnect
                to voters with bold policies that give them something to vote for,
                not just against.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Kent is also running to represent District 32 in Maryland's House of
                Delegates in 2018.
