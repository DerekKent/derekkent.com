            <time datetime="2017-01-18">Jan. 18, 2017</time>

            <p>
                Democracy for America is considering endorsing Derek Kent for
                the District 32 primary, but they need to <a href="https://www2.democracyforamerica.com/endorsement_applicants/702-friends-of-derek-kent">hear from supporters
                like you</a>!
            </p>

            <p>
                Democracy for America is a grassroots, member-driven political action
                committee that works to get progressive leaders like Derek elected.
                Every endorsement they make is informed by individuals like you, not
                a select group of wealthy donors.
            </p>

            <p>
                It only takes a few seconds to <a href="https://www2.democracyforamerica.com/endorsement_applicants/702-friends-of-derek-kent">voice your support</a>,
                but it could make a huge difference.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let's not go another four years without a strong voice from Anne Arundel
                County speaking up for a middle class that has been continuously eroded
                for decades while the very wealthiest members of society become even
                wealthier.
            </p>

            <h2>Derek Kent Elected to District 32 Executive Board</h2>
            <time datetime="2016-11-17">Nov. 17, 2016</time>

            <p>
                <span class="location"><span class="city">Ferndale</span>, Md.</span> –
                Derek Kent on Thursday was one of 13 people nominated and elected to
                the District 32 Democratic Executive Board.
            </p>

            <p>
                Kent spoke after his election about the need for Democrats to reconnect
                with their base.
            </p>

            <p>
                “The election of Donald Trump has been a shock to people around
                the country and around the world, and has shown that Democrats cannot
                continue to pander to corporations and large donors at the expense
                of hard-working Americans, nor can we take for granted the support
                of laborers, unions, and young voters,” Kent said. “We must reconnect
                to voters with bold policies that give them something to vote for,
                not just against.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Kent is also running to represent District 32 in Maryland's House of
                Delegates in 2018.
